## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript



### What I learned

Through this project, I gained an understanding of building an interactive rating interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can choose a rating and submit it to reveal a gratitude message.

The HTML structure involves creating two <section> elements representing the rating and thank-you states. By utilizing classes such as .rating-state and .thankyou-state and toggling their visibility with the .active class, I managed state transitions. Moreover, I defined rating buttons with the .boton class and a submit button with the .rating-state__submit class.

To enhance user experience, I learned to implement default disablement of the rating-state__submit button. It activates upon selecting a rating, ensuring user engagement. Lastly, I incorporated CSS transitions to smoothly alter the background color and text color of interactive elements, enhancing visual feedback for user interactions.



### Continued development

I want to keep learning about the endless possibilities that using JavaScript offers. Currently, I find it a bit challenging to achieve codes quickly, but after spending some time analyzing, I can eventually reach the desired outcome.
